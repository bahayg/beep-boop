# _Beep Boop_

#### _Given a task to build a "Beep Boop" website for Epicodus as a Week 3 Independent Project, 08/23/19_
### _** By Bahay Gulle Bilgi**_

## Description

Built an application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number.
### Website should have:

Features that return a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:
- Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
- Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
- Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
- These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third.
- A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
